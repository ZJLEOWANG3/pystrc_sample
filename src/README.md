# The actual modules for this project
## /utils
> a place where you can place small snippets you can use throughout the application. Small functions to build bigger things with.
> A Utility class is understood to only have static methods and be stateless. You would not create an instance of such a class

## /helpers
> a place where you store code architectural snippets in my view. Things essential for bootstrapping components and developer ergonomics
> A Helper can be a utility class or it can be stateful or require an instance be created. I would avoid this if possible.
